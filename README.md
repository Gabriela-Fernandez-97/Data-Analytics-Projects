**Project Summary**: Southern Water Corp., an Israeli water desalination company, is experiencing increased demand for its freshwater from residential, public, and private sectors, leading to higher revenues. However, with varying operational expenses due to the different types of water required by each segment, the company aims to prevent unsustainable cost rises. Residential use demands soft water, while public and private sectors need a mix of soft and hard water, impacting the cost structures of the three desalination plants. Management is keen to understand if the revenue boost has resulted in a significant increase in production costs.
