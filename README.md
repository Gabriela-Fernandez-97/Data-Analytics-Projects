## Southern Water Corp Financial Case Study (Excel and Powerpoint) 
**Part 1. Project Summary**: 

Southern Water Corp., an Israeli water desalination company, is experiencing increased demand for its freshwater from residential, public, and private sectors, leading to higher revenues. However, with varying operational expenses due to the different types of water required by each segment, the company aims to prevent unsustainable cost rises. Residential use demands soft water, while public and private sectors need a mix of soft and hard water, impacting the cost structures of the three desalination plants. Management is keen to understand if the revenue boost has resulted in a significant increase in production costs.

- Macro-revenue trends across aggregated data (includes data visualization).
- Overall % contribution of each customer segment (includes data visualization).

### Cost Analysis:
- Discovered trends in monthly expenses per plant across 12 months.
- Macro-revenue trends across aggregated data (includes data visualization).
- Identified relationships between monthly water production and monthly chemical expenditures.

### EBIT Analysis: 
- Discovered trends in monthly EBIT per plant across 12 months. 
- Calculated EBIT margins per plant across 12 months.

**Part 2. Project Summary**: 

Due to increasing agricultural and residential water demand, Southern Water Corp maximized its desalination plants' output, boosting revenue. However, SWC aims to avoid unsustainable cost increases. Economic factors significantly impact SWC, which operates in a competitive open water market where water is traded by mega-liters at the Water Market Balancing Price (WMBP). The WMBP fluctuates with supply and demand, necessitating an understanding of market demand to optimize revenue opportunities. Additionally, SWC's desalination plants must be cost-effective; otherwise, customers will prefer cheaper alternatives from competitors.

### Economic Market Analysis:
- Discovered trends in monthly Average Water Balancing Price (WBMP) and average quantities of water demanded across 12 months. 
- Identified elasticity across products (macro and micro).
- Calculated Elasticity of Deman Coefficient (EoD).

### Economic Cost Analysis:
- Calculated cost to produce of 3 plants across 12 months. 
- Identified relationships between cost to produce and volume of water produced. 
- Calculated financial variance between actuals and budget.  

### What-If Analysis:
- Forecasted future demand profile.
- Identified highest and lowest performing quarters. 
- Recommended best quarter for future maintenance shutdown.

**Part 3. Project Summary**:

You helped Southern Water Corp improve their understanding of financial and economic performance across three desalination units: Kootha, Surjek, and Jutik. You identified Surjek as the most expensive water producer due to high maintenance costs from failing desalination pumps. The Engineering Team, responsible for maintaining all three units, is stretched thin and unable to monitor data continuously. To assist, create a data-driven alarm system to detect pump failures. Using inferential statistics, analyze data, establish correlations, and develop a multiple regression equation to simulate pump failure. This proactive Statistical Data Alarm will notify engineers when to check Surjekâ€™s pump performance.

### Descriptive Statistics Analysis:
- Discovered trends using line plots
- Plotted Rolling Stdev and Rolling Means
- Created and analyzed box plots to identify variability
  
### Inferential Statistics Analysis:
- Created correlated heat lamps
- Identified variables related to Pump Failure
- Used regressive equation to create a statistical alarm for Pump Failure.
