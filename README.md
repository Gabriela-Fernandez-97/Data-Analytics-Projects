## American Energy Market Regulator Case Study (SQL and Tableau) 

**Project Summary**:

The American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) oversees the reliability of the USA's domestic energy network, minimizing disruptions known as outages. Of the four types of outages, the AEMR penalizes only forced outages, as they can threaten network reliability if energy supply cannot meet demand.
Recently, the AEMR has noted an increase in outage submissions for 2016 and 2017. The management team has two primary concerns, energy stability and market outages, and energy losses and market reliability. As an analyst, you are tasked with addressing these concerns by using SQL  and Tableau to extract and analyze relevant data, answering queries, and providing additional insights for the management team.

## ChemCorp Case Study (Tableau)

**Project Summary**:

ChemCorp, a leading chemical producer, has experienced strong market demand, averaging 7% annual growth, leading to expansions across 48 states. Despite this, increased competition from startups using advanced technologies like machine learning and AI has become a concern. Five long-term customers, representing about 10% of sales revenue, have recently switched providers, prompting ChemCorp to take immediate action. 
A team from Commercial, Strategy, and Business Analytics was formed to address this issue and prevent further market share loss, which could undermine management's credibility and affect dividend payments. ChemCorp’s portfolio includes six industries (Aerospace Defence, Biotechnology, Machinery and Industrial Goods, Medical Equipment, Paper and Packaging, Pharmaceuticals) and eleven chemical products (including specialty chemicals A, G, and J).
Management's high-level problem statement is focused on preventing future market share loss by identifying growth industries and potential divestment products.

## Southern Water Corp Financial Case Study (Excel and Powerpoint) 
**Part 1. Project Summary**: 

Southern Water Corp., an Israeli water desalination company, is experiencing increased demand for its freshwater from residential, public, and private sectors, leading to higher revenues. However, with varying operational expenses due to the different types of water required by each segment, the company aims to prevent unsustainable cost rises. Residential use demands soft water, while public and private sectors need a mix of soft and hard water, impacting the cost structures of the three desalination plants. Management is keen to understand if the revenue boost has resulted in a significant increase in production costs.

**Part 2. Project Summary**: 

Due to increasing agricultural and residential water demand, Southern Water Corp maximized its desalination plants' output, boosting revenue. However, SWC aims to avoid unsustainable cost increases. Economic factors significantly impact SWC, which operates in a competitive open water market where water is traded by mega-liters at the Water Market Balancing Price (WMBP). The WMBP fluctuates with supply and demand, necessitating an understanding of market demand to optimize revenue opportunities. Additionally, SWC's desalination plants must be cost-effective; otherwise, customers will prefer cheaper alternatives from competitors.

**Part 3. Project Summary**:

You helped Southern Water Corp improve their understanding of financial and economic performance across three desalination units: Kootha, Surjek, and Jutik. You identified Surjek as the most expensive water producer due to high maintenance costs from failing desalination pumps. The Engineering Team, responsible for maintaining all three units, is stretched thin and unable to monitor data continuously. To assist, create a data-driven alarm system to detect pump failures. Using inferential statistics, analyze data, establish correlations, and develop a multiple regression equation to simulate pump failure. This proactive Statistical Data Alarm will notify engineers when to check Surjek’s pump performance.
